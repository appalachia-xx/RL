# reset, the environment to get the first observation of the environment

# step, moving a robot or pressing a button on a gamesâ€™ controller that causes a change 
# within the environment.

# As a result, the agent receives a new observation from the updated environment along with 
# a reward for taking the action. This reward could be for instance positive for destroying 
# an enemy or a negative reward for moving into lava.

# However, after some timesteps, the environment may end, this is called the terminal state. 
# For instance, the robot may have crashed, or the agent have succeeded in completing a task, 
# the environment will need to stop as the agent cannot continue. In gymnasium, if the environment
# has terminated, this is returned by step. Similarly, we may also want the environment to end 
# after a fixed number of timesteps, in this case, the environment issues a truncated signal. 
# If either of terminated or truncated are true then reset should be called next to restart the 
# environment.
